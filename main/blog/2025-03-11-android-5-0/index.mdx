## Interactive Access Points

When using OsmAnd, you can now interact with access-related icons such as *Barrier*, *Steps*, or *Gate* directly on the map. A simple tap on these icons will bring up detailed information, including the name of the POI, its type, and the address.  

This functionality enhances quick access to important navigation data for objects on your route, helping you understand restrictions or attributes of paths and roads at a glance. You can explore this via the [map context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#overview).

By tapping on icons for *Barrier*, *Steps*, or *Gate*, the context menu reveals additional details, including the name (POI type) and address associated with these features, or displays object type, if a name is not available.

## New Route Guidance Widgets

We are excited to introduce a new set of route guidance widgets to the [Top/Bottom widget panels](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#top-and-bottom-panels) in OsmAnd's *Configure screen menu*. These widgets give you real-time navigation information, including the distance to the next turn, second next turn, lane guidance, road name, and current street name. Perfect for keeping track of your route at every step of your journey. The widgets are active during navigation, ensuring you never miss a turn!

*Find them in: Menu â†’ Configure screen â†’ Top panel / Bottom panel â†’ Route guidance: Next turn, Second next turn, Lanes*
