- Interactive Access Points
- New Route Guidance Widgets
- [Optional updates](#optional-updates). Additional updates and refinements for the release.

## Interactive Access Points

When using OsmAnd, you can now interact with access-related icons such as *Barrier*, *Steps*, or *Gate* directly on the map. A simple tap on these icons will bring up detailed information, including the name of the POI, its type, and the address.  

This functionality enhances quick access to important navigation data for objects on your route, helping you understand restrictions or attributes of paths and roads at a glance. You can explore this via the [map context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#linear-object).

Tapping on *barrier*, *steps*, *gates*, *benches* and other icons in the context menu displays additional information, including the name (POI type) and address associated with these objects, or displays the object type if the name is not available.

## New Route Guidance Widgets

We are excited to introduce a new set of route guidance widgets to the [Top/Bottom widget panels](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#top-and-bottom-panels) in OsmAnd's *Configure screen menu*. These widgets give you real-time navigation information, including the distance to the next turn, second next turn, lane guidance, road name, and current street name. Perfect for keeping track of your route at every step of your journey. The widgets are active during navigation, ensuring you never miss a turn!

*Find them in: Menu → Configure screen → Top panel / Bottom panel → Route guidance: Next turn, Second next turn, Lanes*
