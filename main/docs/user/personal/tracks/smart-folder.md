## Smart Folder

![My places tracks sort function Android](@site/static/img/personal/tracks/my_places_smart_folder_andr.png)

*Smart Folder* is a special type of folder that provides intelligent and automated features for organizing and managing tracks.  

1. **Automated organization.** *Smart folder* can automatically sort files within itself based on specified rules or criteria. For example, you can set up a *Smart folder* so that all tracks created on a certain date are automatically moved to that folder.
2. **Filtering and searching.** This folder can provide options to quickly search for tracks within itself using various filters and keywords. These help users to quickly find the tracks they are looking for.
3. **Dynamic refresh.** *Smart folder* can dynamically update its contents based on the Refresh function. This allows you to always have up-to-date information inside the folder.
4. **Customize rules.** You can customize rules that determine which files should be included in the *Smart folder*.

### Create Smart Folder

To create a smart folder, follow these steps:

1. Tap the *three-dot menu* icon in the upper right corner of the screen in the *Tracks* tab.
2. Select the *Add smart folder* option from the menu that appears after tapping the icon.
3. Set the parameters of the smart folder:
   - **Name the folder** (Enter a new name) for identification.
   - Specify **track filter parameters** from the [Filter](#available-filters) list. These parameters determine which tracks will be automatically displayed in the smart folder.
4. Save the settings. Tap *Show* in the lower right corner of the screen, and then tap the *Save* button.

After completing these steps, the Smart Folder will automatically collect and display tracks matching the specified filter parameters.
