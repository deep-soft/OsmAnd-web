## Overview

The following products now support cross-platform access:
- **OsmAnd Pro** subscription  
- **Maps+** subscription  
- **Maps+** in-app purchase

Previously, only the [**OsmAnd Pro**](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#cross-platform) subscription offered cross-platform functionality.  
Starting with **OsmAnd version 5.0**, released in celebration of our **15th anniversary**, we are extending **cross-platform support to Maps+** (formerly known as *Unlimited*).

This means you can now use your **Maps+** purchase across both **Android** and **iOS** platforms by linking it to your [**OsmAnd Cloud**](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login) account.


## How It Works

To use **Maps+/Pro** across platforms, you first need to **link your purchase** to your OsmAnd Cloud account.

Follow these steps on the **device where you made the purchase** (Android or iOS, version 5.0 or later):
1. [**Log in or create an OsmAnd Cloud account**](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login):  
   _Go to **Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud → Create new account / I already have an account**_.
2. Once logged in, your **Maps+/Pro purchase** will be automatically linked to your account and marked as **cross-platform**.

To activate Maps+/Pro on a different device or platform:  
1. [**Log in using the same OsmAnd Cloud account**](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login):  
   _Go to **Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud**._
2. **Verify your purchase**  
   _Go to **Menu → Settings → Purchases** to confirm that Maps+ has been added._

**Troubleshooting**:
If you don’t see your **Maps+/Pro** purchase listed:

1. Tap _**Menu → Settings → Purchases → Restore purchases**_ to refresh your list of purchases.
2. Make sure you're logged into the **correct OsmAnd Cloud account** (the one used to link your purchase).

If the issue persists after these steps, please contact us at **support@osmand.net**.


### Example

You purchased **Maps+** as an in-app purchase in the free version of OsmAnd from the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/OsmAnd-Maps-Navigation/dp/B00D0SA8I8).  
Later, you decide to switch to an iPhone and want to use **Maps+** with the [OsmAnd iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257).

To activate your Maps+ purchase on iOS:

1. Open the **Amazon version** of the OsmAnd app on your old device.
2. Log in to your [OsmAnd Cloud account](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login) from **Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud**.
3. On your iPhone, install OsmAnd from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257).
4. Log in to the **same OsmAnd Cloud account** used on your previous device.
5. Go to _**Menu → Settings → Purchases**_ and verify that **Maps+** is listed.

Enjoy using Maps+/Pro across platforms!
